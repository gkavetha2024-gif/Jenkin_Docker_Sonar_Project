This repository contains the source and configuration for a production-like CI/CD pipeline built with Jenkins, SonarQube, Docker, GitHub Webhooks, and AWS EC2. The pipeline automates the path from code commit to deployment, enforcing quality gates and producing reproducible containerized builds.

## Project Overview:
 Developed a fully automated CI/CD pipeline designed to streamline software delivery from code commit to production deployment. Every push to the GitHub repository triggers a robust workflow build, test, code  quality analysis, and deployment ensuring security, reliability, and seamless integration with AWS infrastructure.
 
 - Trigger builds on every GitHub push via Webhooks
 - Run SonarQube static analysis and Quality Gates
 - Build & tag Docker images automatically
 - Deploy containers to AWS EC2 (or pull from registry)
 - Improve release velocity and enforce code quality

 --- 
## Key features:

- 🖥️ Git & GitHub – Version control + repo management
- ⚙️ Jenkins – Orchestrates the entire CI/CD process
- 🔔 GitHub Webhooks – Triggers pipeline on every push
- 🔍 SonarQube – Code quality & security scanning
- 🐳 Docker – Packaging and consistent deployment
- ☁️ AWS EC2 – Three instances hosting Jenkins, SonarQube & Docker nodes

---

## Pipeline Workflow:

- Developer commits code → GitHub Repository
- GitHub Webhook → Notifies Jenkins instantly
- Build Stage → Jenkins pulls the repo & compiles
- Quality Gate → SonarQube scans for issues
- Docker Build → Image creation + tagging
- Push/Deploy → Deployed into AWS EC2 automatically <br/>

<p>  The entire pipeline is designed to be fully re-runnable and scalable. </p>

--- 

## Prerequisites:

- GitHub repository for the application
- Jenkins server with plugins: Pipeline, GitHub, Docker Pipeline, SonarQube Scanner, Credentials Binding
- SonarQube server reachable from Jenkins
- Docker installed on build/deploy hosts
- AWS account with EC2 instances (Jenkins, SonarQube optional, Docker host)
- Configured GitHub Webhook pointing to Jenkins

## Setup Instructions:

### 1) Launch EC2 Instances on AWS

Three EC2 instances are used to host the following servers:

- Jenkins Server → Builds an automated pipeline and includes plugins such as SonarQube and SSH2 Easy.
- Docker Server → Deploys the website and makes it accessible to end users.
- SonarQube Server → Performs code quality and security checks.


<p>Each EC2 instance is configured with the necessary dependencies and plugins.<p/>

### 2) Create an SSH Connection Between Jenkins EC2 and Docker EC2

- Generate SSH keys on the Jenkins server:
``` bash
  ssh-keygen -t rsa
```

- Copy the SSH key to the Docker EC2 instance using its public IP address for passwordless authentication:
``` bash
  ssh-copy-id ubuntu@<ip-address>
```

### 3) Configure Jenkins Plugins and Jobs

- Install the SSH2 Easy plugin in Jenkins to manage secure SSH connections.
- Set up server groups and sites for Jenkins, SonarQube, and Docker.
- Create a Jenkins job:

   - Add the GitHub repository link.
   - Specify the branch to build and deploy.
   - Add build steps to copy code from Jenkins to SonarQube and Docker instances.
 
### 4) Build a Docker Container and Deploy it

- Create a Dockerfile and run the following commands:
  ``` bash
  docker build -t automated-pipeline .
  ```

  ``` bash
  docker run -d --name custom-container -p 8085:80 automated-pipeline
  ```

## What I learned:

 - Real-world pipeline debugging (tokens, credentials, agent configs)
 - SonarQube quality gates and their role in CI
 - Docker image lifecycle and deployment considerations
 - Basic cloud deployments and ingress configuration


--- 

## Next steps:

 - Move images to AWS ECR
 - Use Terraform for infrastructure-as-code
 - Switch to Kubernetes (EKS) for orchestration
 - Add Slack/Teams notifications and rollback strategies
